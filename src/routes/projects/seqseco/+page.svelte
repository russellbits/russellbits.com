		<h2>Genesis</h2>
		<p>
			Many of us are famliar with a workout in which you engage in some acitivty for x minutes and
			then rest for y minutes, perhaps switching to a second activity for x minutes followed by a
			rest period for y minutes. I engage in this kind of workout and found it was too difficult to
			set and reset a timer during the workout. What I felt was needed was a sequence of timers in
			which timer A, when finished, sets off timer B and so forth. With that simple idea in mind, I
			began sketching concepts.

			With several conceptual drafts worked out, I can begin to see what components might be useful,
			what framing devices might be useful, what controls will be needed and what settings as well.
			For instance, while drafting this particular web app, it occurred to me that two useful states
			would be one in which the timer automatically sets off the next timer, or finishes and waits
			for the user to press a "next" buttonâ€”definitely a setting. It's at this stage that it's
			useful to move to the computer and begin drafting.

		<p>
			Once a general design aesthetic has been settled on, it's time to carry that look to every
			potential screen in the app, working screens into a logical flow. I utilize <a
				href="https://www.sketch.com">Sketch</a
			> on the Mac to create these screen designs. Sketch has a modular system for graphics built into
			it, so it is relatively easy to move from component images to component code.
		</p>
		<p>
			Moving from graphics to code can involve an intermediate step which is creating a <a
				href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-systems-101-what-is-a-design-system/"
				>design system</a
			>. With a larger team, the design system allows for the designers on the team to make aestetic
			changes (margins, padding, font sizes) and gives developers code to copy into the build.
